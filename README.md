# Classification of Neuro-Degenerative Diseases Based on Support Vector Machines(SVM)
Given a raw dataset of foot force data in 5 minutes of walking with four classes labelled against each instance of database (Healthy/ALS/HD/PD), one needed to extract relevant features from the raw dataset and convert it into useful information .

Then train a supervised classifier to classify the training dataset created correctly using cross validation and finally test the trained model over a blind test dataset.

Pipeline used :

MATLAB for noise reduction, feature extraction (as it is least time consuming and good for signal procecssing).

Weka for pre-processing, classification, feature slection, mapping, model training, iterating with various ML algorithms.

Excel for result visualization, data manipulation.
